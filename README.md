## Hey there

This script is to apply the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF)
on remote sensing reflectance data and generate the Principal Components (PC)

The script organizes data from Ocean Color (Aqua MODIS sensor) in .nc
(you can download your own data from https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/)

Everything you need to know for understanding it is written on the comments.

**Enjoy**
