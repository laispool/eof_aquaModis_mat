## Hey there

This script (eof_aquaModis.m) is to apply the Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF)
on remote sensing reflectance data and generate the Principal Components (PC).

The script also organizes data from Ocean Color (Aqua MODIS sensor) in .nc
(you can download your own data from https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/).

A second script (ts_variance) is to test trends of the signal resulted from the temporal series PCs.

Everything you need to know for understanding it is written on the comments.

**Enjoy**
